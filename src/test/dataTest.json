Enclosed with this letter you will find your new membership card and your guest passes.<br />\n<br />\nAdditionally, we have created an easier way for members to provide feedback. On our Web site at www.feedback.hdabroadcasing.org are several short comment forms for each of our programs. We have also recently created a feedback form to evaluate our membership program. We would greatly appreciate it if you would take five minutes to fill it out.<br />\n<br />\nBest Wishes,<br />\nBryce Garcia, HDA Member Services<br />\n<br />\n___________________________<br />\n<br />\nwww.feedback.hdabroadcasing.org<br />\n<b>HDA Membership Feedback Form</b><br />\n<br />\nName: Charlotte Potter<br />\n<br />\n<b>Do you feel the membership is worth the cost?</b><br />\nI think the $125/year rate is a little high for what my membership gives me in return. However, I pay for the membership not because I want the benefits, but because I want to support the broadcasting you provide. The rest is just a bonus for me.<br />\n<br />\n<b>What is the most important benefit of membership?</b><br />\nI really enjoy my copies of the HDA Broadcasting magazine. It is quite interesting and full of useful information.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Do you have any other comments?</b><br />\nI recently renewed my membership, but only my free passes were included with the thank you letter I received. Could you please send me the item that I am still missing?</p>\n","image":"","sound":"","hint":""},"answer":{"texts":[],"choices":[],"image":"","sound":"","hint":""},"code":"","status":1,"lastUpdate":1659435131490,"difficultyLevel":0,"orderIndex":1656132784678,"type":1636615746924,"setting":{"shuffleAnswer":0,"additional":"","maxPoint":0,"pointType":0,"splitPointAnswers":false},"childCards":[{"_id":"62b694afbbc57b27fe10f89b","parentId":"62b694aebbc57b27fe10f814","hasChild":0,"question":{"text":"What is indicated about HDA Broadcasting?","image":"","sound":"","hint":""},"answer":{"texts":["(B)It has an Internet-based store."],"choices":["(A)Its memberships can be canceled at any time.","(C)It sponsors four events per year.","(D)It sends out weekly e-mails."],"image":"","sound":"","hint":"<p>Information can be inferred from <em>&quot;a 20% discount on our <strong>online merchandise</strong>&quot; </em>and <em>&quot;On our Web site at www.feedback.hdabroadcasing.org&quot;</em></p>\n"},"code":"","status":1,"lastUpdate":1659435131848,"difficultyLevel":0,"orderIndex":1656132784576,"type":1636615746924,"setting":{"shuffleAnswer":0,"additional":"","maxPoint":0,"pointType":0,"splitPointAnswers":false},"childCards":[],"isRender":true,"tags":[],"games":[],"pairs":[],"trapPairs":[]},{"_id":"62b694afbbc57b27fe10f89c","parentId":"62b694aebbc57b27fe10f814","hasChild":0,"question":{"text":"What is Ms. Potter’s membership level?","image":"","sound":"","hint":""},"answer":{"texts":["(C)Supporter"],"choices":["(A)Individual","(B)Family","(D)Sponsor"],"image":"","sound":"","hint":"<p>In the website, there is the information<strong> </strong><em>&quot;I think the $125/year rate is a little high&quot;. </em>Look at the notice, you can see that the membership level which costs $125 is Supporter&nbsp;=&gt; C is correct&nbsp;</p>\n"},"code":"","status":1,"lastUpdate":1659435131851,"difficultyLevel":0,"orderIndex":1656132784577,"type":1636615746924,"setting":{"shuffleAnswer":0,"additional":"","maxPoint":0,"pointType":0,"splitPointAnswers":false},"childCards":[],"isRender":true,"tags":[],"games":[],"pairs":[],"trapPairs":[]},{"_id":"62b694afbbc57b27fe10f89d","parentId":"62b694aebbc57b27fe10f814","hasChild":0,"question":{"text":"In the letter, the word <b>“network”</b> in paragraph 1 is closest in meaning to","image":"","sound":"","hint":""},"answer":{"texts":["(B)station"],"choices":["(A)community","(C)grid","(D)structure"],"image":"","sound":"","hint":"<p>Based on the meaning and context&nbsp;=&gt; Choose B&nbsp;</p>\n"},"code":"","status":1,"lastUpdate":1659435131853,"difficultyLevel":0,"orderIndex":1656132784578,"type":1636615746924,"setting":{"shuffleAnswer":0,"additional":"","maxPoint":0,"pointType":0,"splitPointAnswers":false},"childCards":[],"isRender":true,"tags":[],"games":[],"pairs":[],"trapPairs":[]},{"_id":"62b694afbbc57b27fe10f89e","parentId":"62b694aebbc57b27fe10f814","hasChild":0,"question":{"text":"What does Ms. Potter suggest about the HDA Broadcasting membership?","image":"","sound":"","hint":""},"answer":{"texts":["(D)Its monthly publication is educational."],"choices":["(A)It could add another membership level.","(B)It is appropriately priced for the benefits provided.","(C)It should offer an online renewal option."],"image":"","sound":"","hint":"<p>Information can be inferred from <em>&quot;I really enjoy my copies of the HDA Broadcasting magazine.
